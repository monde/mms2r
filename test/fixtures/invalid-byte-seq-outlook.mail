Aaron - I completed RNS Test Question 3, which was done as a 'Cargo Control=
 Number' query.

Having a problem, per attached, where the EDIFACT file is showing the Notif=
ication_Qualifier (Reference Qualifier) as - TN - which should only be used=
 for Transaction Number queries.

In this case the EDIFACT file should be showing 'ABT' for a Cargo Control N=
umber Query - not TN.

The Express XML is showing 'CC' for the 'Notification_Qualifier' on Cargo C=
ontrol Number queries.

When you get the CC, it has to be shown as ABT in the EDIFACT.

The last test question (2) required query by Transaction Number - so TN was=
 correct.

When you get 'CC' - please change to 'ABT' in the EDIFACT.

Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

Per Judi's email below - RNS Question 2 is correct.
Have sent # 3 now.

Question 2 was sent on Thursday so she is taking a couple days,
or more, to get back with the question status.

Hi Judi,

I have sent the RNS Transaction for Test Question 2 again.
The programmer has fixed the RNS Transaction showing TN for Transaction Num=
ber.

I just re-sent the RNS Query Test 2 again - but got the same results.

Express sent - <notification_qualifier>TN</notification_qualifier>

But - ABT was sent to CBSA again:

The qualifier is mapped. Please retest.

Aaron - TN or ABT are both being included in the XML when oppopriate.
Can you not go by this?

Getting for the Transaction Number query -
<Notification_qualifier>TN</Notification_qualifier>
or
<Notification_qualifier>ABT</Notification_qualifier>

Do you have to have an indicator also?

Should I recreate the RNS transaction to send or are you sending the one yo=
u fixed?
Thanks





#3      Aaron Doe said 5 days ago [Wed, Jan 11, 2012 10:25 AM PST]       =

I changed =93ABT=94 to =93TN=94. If you need to switch between the CCN and =
the TN I will need an indicator in the xml. Don recheck step 1.

When completing the RNS Query Test 2 - sending by Transaction Number - have=
 to send "TN" for the Reference Qualifier, per attached.

But the EDIFACT sent shows ABT (for Cargo Control Number) in error. .

The XML file sent from Express - also attached - does show TN - but the EDI=
FACT file is showing: ABT

Please correct - as soon as possible.

Thanks

I completed the RNS Test Question 2 today. Still waiting to hear the result=
s from Judi at CBSA.

Question 2 requires that you do the query using the Transaction Id.
In this case, Judi told me to use - 14142123913549 for the Transaction Id -=
 which I did.

But, per attached, the Query Responses grid doesn't tell you that this quer=
y was completed by "Transaction Id" and doesn't show the "Transaction Id" u=
sed with the query.

Need to have a column that shows whether the RNS Query was done by Cargo Co=
ntrol Number (CCN), Conveyance Reference, or Transaction Id.

Also need to be able to see the Transaction #, CCN, or Conveyance Reference=
 used within the Query Responses.

This would let the user know what type of query was sent and make it easier=
 to know which RNS Query is which.

Let me know if any questions.

Thanks.
